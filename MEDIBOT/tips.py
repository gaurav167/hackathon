	3 : 'Consult an expert: seek the advice of licensed or registered dietitian to help you create a lifestyle plan, rather than a diet that you go on tog0o off.' ,
    4: '''Carry food with you: getting caught without food will sabotage your
diet faster than you can say "vending machine". Successful dieters
carry a backpack of food with them stuffed with a bottle of water,
fresh fruit, dried fruit and nuts, yogurt, turkey jerky, and a protein
drink.''' ,
5 : """Drink more water it will help control your appetite, not to mention
the health benefits of flushing newly released toxins out of your
body as you burn up fat.""",
6: """ When you think "hungry", are you really thirsty instead?: we often
mistake thirst for hunger. Drink first, if you still are hungry then go
ahead and eat.""",
7: """Avoid high fructose corn syrup: by avoiding this single ingredient
you will eliminate most of the junk food and beverages that are
keeping your saddle bags hanging on tight.""",
8: """ Limit added sugar: too much sugar makes you a fat-builder, not a
fat-burner. Limit all added sugar in your diet to 4 to 6 teaspoons per
day.""",
9: """If you use a non-nutritive sweetener, choose Stevia Plus: It contains
fructo-oligosaccharides that are actually good for your
gastrointestinal tract.""",
10 : """Always combine carbohydrates with protein and/or fat: this will
slow down absorption and keep blood sugar and insulin levels on
target for weight loss.""",
11: """ Eat 5 fish meals each week: an excellent source of protein, fish is
lower in calories and high in omega-3 fats that support fat-burning,
especially around your abs.""",

12: """Eat whole grains: by replacing all refined cereals, flours and grains
with whole grains you'll keep your insulin levels in balance, and fill
yourself up with great nutrients and fiber to help control your
appetite and slow absorption of total fat.""",

13: """Limit grains to 3 servings per day: this leaves enough room for
fruits and vegetables, yet doesn't put you in the red zone of your
carbohydrate intake.""",

14: """Drink milk: and yogurt and cheese to consume healthy amounts of
calcium. Calcium consumption from dairy products has been shown
to help with weight loss and weight control.""",

15 : """Use whey protein: it's hard for most women to get in enough
protein, especially right after your workout when you most need it.
Whey protein gives you an abundance of the amino acids necessary
for rapid recovery, so that you can get to your next day's workout full
of energy.""",

16: """Say soy, please: soy protein helps you hang onto your muscle
tissue as you burn fat, and soy fiber helps reduce total fat
absorption. Edamame is your most ideal choice.""",
17: """ Choose lean meats: by choosing the leanest cuts of meat you will
cut down on your fat and calories, and help your heart at the same
time. These include sirloin, tenderloin, eye of round, top round, top
loin and round tip.""",

18:""" Add ground flax seed or oil to your diet: the alpha-linolenic acid
converts to omega-3 in your body. It helps burn fat and avoid
depression.""",

19 :"""Take a walk: instead of a snack.""",

20: """Turn off the TV: The temptation to sit still and eat is too great. Get
up and get moving.""",

21: """Get a hobby: keep your hands and your mind busy, and away from
food.""",

22:""" Skip the juice: eat only whole fruit. You'll lose calories and add
healthy fiber at the same time.""",

23: """Add nuts back into your diet: although they are a dense source of
fat and calories, the fats are healthy and will give you tremendous
satiety. Just make sure to measure out a serving and don't eat from
the jar.""",

24: """Eat breakfast: worldwide, people who eat breakfast have better
weight control compared to those who skip breakfast.""",

25: """Don't skip meals: you will find yourself panic eating from
uncontrolled appetite surges. Skipping meals does not help you lose
weight. Instead you will slow your metabolic rate down and be
further from your goal.""",
26: """ Eat enough calories: very low calorie diets work at first, but quickly
slow your metabolic rate to the point that you don't lose any more
weight. Eat enough to fuel your exercise so that you can train harder,
increase muscle and metabolic rate, and then burn fat.""",

27: """Strength train: muscle is the calorie-burning machinery in your
body. The more you have and the more you work it, the more
calories you'll burn all day long.""",

28: """Get a ball: When you have to sit still, whether at your desk or in
front of the tube, sit on an exercise ball. You'll get a continuous
balance workout and burn a few extra calories.""",

29: """Do it by hand: little things like sweeping instead of using an electric
broom and washing dishes instead of using the dishwasher all use
more calories that add up at the end of the day.""",

30: """Eat more fruits and vegetables: The fiber and nutrients will help
keep you satisfied and well-nourished.""",

31: """Be picky about portion control: without it, you could be off by
hundreds of calories every day.""",

a day (or the extract according to directions) can help you burn more
calories and lose weight.""",

33: """Out with alcohol: it will slow or even halt your weight loss. Drink a
fruit juice spritzer made with grape or cranberry juice and sparkling
water instead.""",

34: """Up with protein: when you reduce your calories you need more
protein. It will also help you control your appetite, burn more
calories, and hold onto your muscle as you lose fat.""",

35: """Eliminate sports drinks: unless you're training for competition,
sports drinks will slow your fat burning during exercise and probably
add unneeded calories. Drink water instead.""",

36: """Eat most of your carbs before 6 PM: insulin is released on a
circadium rhythm, and secretions slow down around 6 PM. You can
still have some carb afterward, but get most of your carbs earlier in
the day.""",

37: """Eat after exercise: you need to refuel and recover so that you have
plenty of energy to stay active the rest of the day, and exercise hard
the following day. Have some protein and carb immediately after
exercise.""",

38: """Sup some soup: it's a great way to support your weight loss plan.""",

39: """Limit restaurant food: it's full of hidden fat and calories. You'll have
the best control when you eat at home.""",

41: """Bag the chips: replace them with baked varieties, and soy crisps
and nuts.""",

42:"""Get your rest: seven to 8 hours of sleep is ideal to promote rest,

keep your metabolic rate elevated all day long.""",

44: """If all else fails, chew gum: sometimes you just can't get past the
craving. If you don't want to give into it, then try sugar-free gum
sweetened with xylitol. It will clean your teeth at the same time.""",

45: """Diet with a buddy: a partner in the process makes all the difference.""",

46: """Go shopping: celebrate successes with something other than food.""",

47: """Focus on the company, not the food: at a social gathering, stand
away from the buffet table and socialize. Food is not the main
attraction.""",

48: """BYOD: when invited to a dinner party, offer to bring your own dish.
That way you can make sure to have something that fits in your diet
plan.""",

49: """Go small: choose a small salad plate in the buffet line, rather than a
large dinner plate. It will limit the amount of food you can pile on
your plate.""",
